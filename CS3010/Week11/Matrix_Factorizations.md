# LU Factorization
- A: The standard matrix
- U: The upper triangular form matrix
- L: The lower triangular form matrix
- A = LU
- We can only do basic row operation of Ri - kRj
- We want to get the upper triangular form, recording what k values we used
- The lower triangular form is just the k values
- M* matrix is just the L but only in one column

# LDL Factorization
- A: The standard matrix
- U: The upper triangular form matrix
- L: The lower triangular form matrix
- D: The diagonal matrix
- U = DL
- A = LU
- LU = LDL
- Same but must be symmetrical and extract diagonal from upper into a separate matrix
