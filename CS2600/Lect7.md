## Structs
- Basically Kotlin data class
- A way to organize data as a new type
- Reference elements with period (`a.b`)
- Create instance: `struct <STRUCT> <NAME>;`
- If we have a struct pointer, reference with arrow (`a->b`)

## Unions
- Basically we can store multiple different types of data
- But we can only store one object at a time
- For example, a struct can be an int, float, and char, but only one of those can be occupied at once
